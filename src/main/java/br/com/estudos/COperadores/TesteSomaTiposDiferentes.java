		Remember that whenever both the operands of a mathematical operator (such as / and *) are integral types except long (i.e. byte, char, short, and int), the result is always the integer value that remains after truncating the fractional value. For example, 5/3 is 1.6666 but the result will be 1 after removing the fractional part. Observe that there is no "rounding off" here.

		In the expression given in this question, starting, firstValue, and secondValue are of type byte, short, and int respectively. Thus, the above rule is applicable here. Therefore, starting/2 will result in 1, firstValue/2 will result in 2, firstValue/3 will result in 1, and secondValue/2 will result in 3. The expression will therefore be equivalent to:

		      (int) ( 1 + 2 + 1 ) + 3
		=> (int)(4) + 3
		=> 7

		Although not important for this question, you should remember that the type of the result will be int even if both the operands are of a type that is smaller than an int. Thus, the following will not compile -
		byte b1 = 1;
		byte b2 = 2;
		byte b = b1 + b2; //result is of type int, which cannot be assigned directly to a byte

		You have to use a cast:
		byte b = (byte) (b1 + b2); //OK now

		Similarly, when one of the operands is of type long, float, or double and the other operand is of a smaller size, the result will be a long, float, or double respectively.
